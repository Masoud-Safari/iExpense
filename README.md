# iExpense: Personal Expense Tracker

## Introduction

iExpense is a personal finance app designed to help users track their daily expenses and manage their budgets more effectively. Developed as part of my journey through learning Swift and SwiftUI, this app showcases the use of advanced SwiftUI concepts, data persistence, and user interface design to create a practical and user-friendly application.

## Project Description

### What the App Does

- **Functionality:** iExpense allows users to add, edit, and delete their personal expenses, categorizing them into custom groups for better organization. Each expense entry includes details such as the item name, category, and amount of transaction. The app provides a summary view, displaying the user's spending habits over time and helping them to understand where their money goes.
- **Technologies Used:** The app is built with SwiftUI and leverages UserDefaults and Codable for data persistence, ensuring that users' expense data is saved and available across app launches. It also uses advanced SwiftUI features for dynamic list handling.
- **App Demo:**

### Purpose and Learning

- **Objective:** The primary goal of developing iExpense was to gain a deeper understanding of SwiftUI and explore apps with multiple views and data persistence mechanisms within iOS apps.
- **Challenges and Solutions:** One of the main challenges was ensuring data persistence across app restarts. Implementing UserDefaults and Codable for storing and retrieving structured data was initially daunting, but through careful study and experimentation, I was able to achieve seamless data persistence. Additionally, creating an intuitive user interface that could handle dynamic data effectively required thoughtful design and implementation of SwiftUI views.
- **Skills Gained:** Through this project, I significantly improved my knowledge of SwiftUI, understanding how to manage state and utilize bindings. I also gained practical experience in managing and persisting data in iOS applications, enhancing my overall proficiency in app development.
